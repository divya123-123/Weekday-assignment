                We are a fast-growing Bay Area-based startup backed by leading
                investors like Menlo Ventures, Accel and Y-Combinator. We create
                AI and ML-powered software for the finance and lending
                industries, focused on repayment and debt recovery. We work to
                improve conversations between call center agents and customers
                and provide actionable insights. Our products use AI to create
                next-generation speech analytics that support real-time agent
                guidance, automated notes after conversations, and call analysis
                for quality assurance and compliance.

                The team has deep technical talent today and we believe there is
                an opportunity to build an iconic vertical software business
                that will fundamentally impact how the multi-trillion-dollar
                debt industry is managed. Debt has such a massive impact on
                consumers and prior to Prodigal, the industry was saddled with
                painful, low value manual workflows, and poor customer
                experience- our mission is to humanize the debt repayment
                process through automation and data.
